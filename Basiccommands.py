#tutorial on python


#when creating variables no matter what data type you just put a name and assign. No data type needed
a = 3
b = 2
c = a+b 

#regular strings are follwed by just quotes
str1 = "Hello Im anthony"

#If I want to type out a paragraph in python i can do triple quotes and carry on the lines
str2 = """ 
Hello I am anthony,
I like fruit.
I also like to study 
"""


#To print in python I can just do "print(variables)"
print(a+b)
print(str1)
print(str2)

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
#Mathamatical logic

n = 3
#multiplication
m = n*3
print(m)

#This is how you power. 3^3. If I change 3 to 4 it will be 3^4 because n = 3 and **4 means to the power of 4.
m = n**3
print(m)


#Division

#With decimal 
t=11
z= t/1
print(z)

#Without decimal The differnce is the first one is a slash and the second one is double slash. 
t=11
z= t//2
print(z)


#Remainder %
t=11
z= t%2
print(z)

#Printing multiple strings 4 times
s = "hi "
x = "Im here "
print(s*4)

#printing two strings together 
s = "hi "
x = "Im here "
print(s+x)

#If I Want to put a string in quotes I would do this \" text \" inside of 
stringinquotes = "\"hello\""
print(stringinquotes)
stringinquotes = "I am here, \"hello\" "
print(stringinquotes)
